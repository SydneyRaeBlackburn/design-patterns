# design-patterns
Overview and examples of the various software engineering design patterns. This content was extracted from [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) and the book, [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/).

## Design Principles
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact. Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
- Open-Closed Principle - classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

# Getting Started

All examples are written in Go and the markdown utilizes [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) to render the diagrams.

## Requirements
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/README?id=installation)
- [GitHub + Mermaid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-%2B-mermaid/goiiopgdnkogdbjmncgedmgpoajilohe/related?hl=en) Chrome extension to view Mermaid diagrams in GitHub
- `GO111MODULE=off` for local modules
